Here’s a concise, reusable rubric template tailored for 800–1,000 word consumer mental health articles. It fits into a CMS as required fields and checkboxes, keeps one clear message, and ensures 2–3 concrete actions plus an explicit call to action.  CBT stands for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and CMS stands for Content Management System.
