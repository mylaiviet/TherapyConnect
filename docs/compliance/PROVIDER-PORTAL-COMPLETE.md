## Validation & Error Handling

### File Upload Validation:
```typescript
// File types
ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES = ['application/pdf', 'image/jpeg', 'image/png',
                      'image/gif', 'application/msword',
                      'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document']

// File size
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024 // 10MB
```

### Error Messages:
- Invalid file type: "Invalid file type. Please upload PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF, DOC, or DOCX files."
- File too large: "File size exceeds 10MB. Please upload a smaller file."
- Missing document type: "Please select a document type"
- Missing expiration: "Please enter an expiration date for this document type"

### Toast Notifications:
- Success: "Document uploaded", "Document deleted"
- Error: API error messages displayed in destructive variant

- Expiration reminder emails (30, 60, 90 days)
- Alert notification emails

### With Notification System (Future):
- Real-time notifications for alerts
- Document verification notifications
- Phase completion notifications

## Next Steps (Phase 3 Week 4)

**Email Integration:**
1. Email service setup
2. Email templates:
   - Document upload confirmation
   - Document verified
   - Document expiring (30/60/90 days)
   - Credentialing approved
   - Alert notifications
   - Phase completion updates
3. Email preferences (provider can opt in/out)

**Testing:**
1. End-to-end testing of upload workflow
2. Test all alert scenarios
3. Test expiration calculations
4. Test role-based access
5. Test file validation
6. Test responsive design
7. Cross-browser testing

**Production Deployment:**
1. Environment variable configuration
2. Storage backend setup (Supabase/S3)
3. Database migration verification
4. Monitoring and logging setup
5. Performance testing with large files
6. Security audit

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Document Storage (from Phase 3 Week 1)
STORAGE_BACKEND=local                    # or 'supabase' or 's3'
UPLOADS_PATH=./uploads                   # local storage path

# Supabase Storage (if using STORAGE_BACKEND=supabase)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co

```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload document with all 7 document types
- [ ] Upload document with expiration date
- [ ] Upload document without expiration date
- [ ] Validate file type rejection (upload .txt file)
- [ ] Validate file size rejection (upload >10MB file)
- [ ] Download uploaded document
- [ ] Delete unverified document
- [ ] Attempt to delete verified document (should fail)
- [ ] View credentialing progress at different stages
- [ ] View alerts at different severity levels
- [ ] View expiring documents at different urgency levels
- [ ] Test all tab navigation
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile
- [ ] Test with no documents uploaded
- [ ] Test with all documents uploaded and verified
- [ ] Test authentication redirect (non-therapist user)

## Performance Considerations

**Optimizations:**
- React Query caching prevents unnecessary API calls
- File size validation prevents large uploads
- Lazy loading of document thumbnails (future)
- Pagination for large document lists (future)

**Bundle Size:**
- All components use shared UI components
- Icons tree-shaken from lucide-react
- No heavy dependencies added

## Security Considerations

**Authentication:**
- All API endpoints require authentication
- Role-based access (therapists only can access portal)
- Redirect to login if not authenticated

**File Upload Security:**
- File type whitelist validation
- File size limit enforcement
- Server-side validation (in backend)
- Secure file storage paths

**Document Access:**
- Providers can only access their own documents
- Document download requires authentication
- No direct file path exposure

## Known Limitations

1. **No real-time updates:** Must refresh to see admin actions (future: WebSocket integration)
2. **No document preview:** Must download to view (future: in-browser preview for PDFs/images)
3. **No bulk upload:** One file at a time (future: drag-and-drop multiple files)
4. **No document versioning:** Can't track document history (future: version tracking)
5. **No progress indicator:** Upload progress not shown (future: progress bar during upload)

## Success Metrics

**User Experience:**
- Upload success rate >95%
- Time to upload document <30 seconds
- Clear understanding of credentialing status
- Zero confusion about required documents

**Business Impact:**
- Reduced admin burden (self-service document management)
- Faster credentialing completion times
- Fewer support tickets about document status
- Higher provider satisfaction

## Conclusion

The Provider Credentialing Portal is **COMPLETE** and ready for testing. All 5 components have been implemented with comprehensive features, validation, error handling, and user-friendly UI/UX.

**Next Phase:** Email integration and comprehensive testing (Phase 3 Week 4)
