# AWS Lightsail Deployment Issues - Lessons Learned

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Service:** karematch (Lightsail Container Service)
**Final Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Application successfully deployed and running
**Deployment URL:** https://karematch.8e74v5zr8vptw.us-east-1.cs.amazonlightsail.com

---

## Executive Summary

The deployment of KareMatch to AWS Lightsail encountered multiple technical obstacles that delayed the process by approximately 6 hours. The root causes were:

1. **lightsailctl plugin discovery issues** on Windows
2. **USE_PARAMETER_STORE configuration mismatch** causing IAM permission errors
3. **ECR vs Lightsail registry confusion** in deployment scripts

**Final Solution:** Used Docker Hub as the container registry and disabled AWS Parameter Store in favor of direct environment variables.

---

## Issues Encountered (Chronological Order)

### Issue #1: lightsailctl Plugin Not Found (CRITICAL)

**Timeline:** First 4 hours of deployment
**Severity:** üî¥ Critical - Blocked deployment entirely

#### Problem Description

The AWS CLI could not find the `lightsailctl` plugin despite it being installed correctly. This prevented pushing Docker images to Lightsail's built-in registry.

**Error Message:**
```
The Lightsail Control (lightsailctl) plugin was not found.
To download and install it, see https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-install-software
```

#### Root Cause

On Windows, AWS CLI v2 has specific requirements for plugin discovery that differ from Linux/Mac:

1. **Plugin location:** The plugin was installed to `C:\Users\mylai\.aws\plugins\lightsail\bin\lightsailctl.exe`
2. **AWS CLI plugin search path:** AWS CLI v2 on Windows doesn't automatically check `~/.aws/plugins/` like it does on Linux/Mac
3. **PATH requirements:** Even after adding the plugin directory to Windows system PATH, AWS CLI still couldn't discover it as a plugin

#### Attempted Solutions (All Failed)

1. ‚úó Install plugin to user AWS plugins directory: `~/.aws/plugins/lightsail/bin/`
2. ‚úó Add plugin directory to Windows system PATH (permanently via environment variables)
3. ‚úó Set `AWS_PLUGIN_PATH` environment variable
4. ‚úó Copy plugin to AWS CLI installation directory (permission denied)
5. ‚úó Restart PowerShell sessions multiple times
6. ‚úó Direct invocation via `lightsailctl.exe` with piped Docker save

**Why These Failed:**
- AWS CLI v2 on Windows appears to have a different plugin discovery mechanism than documented
- The `push-container-image` command requires AWS CLI to recognize lightsailctl as an official plugin
- Simply having the executable in PATH is not sufficient

#### Working Solution

**Bypassed the lightsailctl plugin entirely by using Docker Hub as the container registry.**

**Steps:**
1. Tagged local image for Docker Hub: `docker tag karematch:latest mylaiviet/karematch:latest`
2. Pushed to Docker Hub: `docker push mylaiviet/karematch:latest`
3. Referenced Docker Hub image in Lightsail deployment: `mylaiviet/karematch:latest`

**Script Created:** [push-via-docker-hub.ps1](../../push-via-docker-hub.ps1)

#### Lessons Learned

1. **Docker Hub is a reliable alternative** to Lightsail's built-in registry
2. **AWS CLI plugin support on Windows is problematic** - avoid relying on it for production workflows
3. **Public registries work fine with Lightsail** - no need for ECR or Lightsail registry for non-sensitive images
4. **Create workarounds early** rather than spending hours debugging AWS CLI internals

#### Prevention for Next Time

**Recommended Approach:**
- Use Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) by default
- Only use Lightsail's built-in registry if absolutely necessary
- If lightsailctl is required, test it thoroughly on Windows first or use AWS CloudShell (browser-based, has lightsailctl pre-installed)

**Alternative: Use AWS CloudShell**
```bash
# In AWS CloudShell (browser-based terminal in AWS Console)
# lightsailctl is pre-installed
aws lightsail push-container-image --service-name karematch --label latest --image karematch:latest
```

---

### Issue #2: IAM Permission Confusion

**Timeline:** Throughout deployment
**Severity:** üü° Medium - Caused errors but workarounds existed

#### Problem Description

Multiple IAM permission errors occurred due to using a limited IAM user (`cli-deployment-user`) that was initially created with minimal permissions.

**Permission Errors Encountered:**

1. **Lightsail service access:**
   ```
   User is not authorized to perform: lightsail:GetContainerServices
   ```

2. **ECR access (when attempting ECR deployment):**
   ```
   User is not authorized to perform: ecr:GetAuthorizationToken
   ```

3. **Lightsail registry login:**
   ```
   User is not authorized to perform: lightsail:CreateContainerServiceRegistryLogin
   ```

4. **SSM Parameter Store access (runtime):**
   ```
   User is not authorized to perform: ssm:GetParameter on resource: arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:663805334680:parameter/karematch/database-url
   ```

#### Root Cause

The IAM user was created with only `AWSLightsailReadOnlyAccess` policy initially, which didn't include:
- Write operations (push images, create deployments)
- ECR access (for ECR-based deployments)
- Systems Manager access (for Parameter Store)

#### Solution

**Added comprehensive Lightsail permissions via inline policy:**

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "lightsail:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Policy Name:** `LightsailFullAccess`

#### Lessons Learned

1. **Start with full service permissions during development** - restrict later in production
2. **IAM policies are service-specific** - Lightsail permissions don't grant ECR access
3. **Container IAM roles ‚â† deployment user IAM permissions** - the Lightsail container service itself needs IAM roles for runtime (like accessing Parameter Store)

#### Prevention for Next Time

**Create deployment IAM user with proper permissions from the start:**

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "lightsail:*",
                "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
                "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
                "ecr:PutImage",
                "ecr:InitiateLayerUpload",
                "ecr:UploadLayerPart",
                "ecr:CompleteLayerUpload",
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

**For Lightsail container runtime access to AWS services:**
- Create an IAM role for the container service (separate from deployment user)
- Attach policies for services the app needs (RDS, S3, SSM, etc.)
- Assign this role to the Lightsail container service

---

### Issue #3: USE_PARAMETER_STORE Misconfiguration (CRITICAL)

**Timeline:** After successful image deployment
**Severity:** üî¥ Critical - Caused deployment failure after image was working

#### Problem Description

The application crashed on startup with:

```
‚ùå FATAL STARTUP ERROR: Error: Failed to load one or more parameters from Parameter Store.
Check IAM permissions and parameter names.
```

**Application was crashing in an infinite restart loop:**
1. Container starts
2. Reads `USE_PARAMETER_STORE=true`
3. Attempts to fetch secrets from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
4. Gets IAM permission denied errors
5. Crashes with fatal error
6. Lightsail restarts container (repeat)

#### Root Cause

**Dual configuration issue:**

1. **Environment variable conflict:**
   - `USE_PARAMETER_STORE=true` was set in environment variables
   - This told the app to fetch secrets from Parameter Store
   - But the actual secrets (`DATABASE_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`) were ALSO in environment variables

2. **Missing IAM role for container:**
   - Lightsail container service didn't have an IAM role assigned
   - Without a role, the container has no AWS API permissions
   - Cannot access Systems Manager Parameter Store

3. **Parameter Store secrets didn't exist:**
   - The app expected parameters at:
     - `/karematch/database-url`
     - `/karematch/session-secret`
     - `/karematch/encryption-key`
   - These parameters were never created in AWS Systems Manager

#### Solution

**Disabled Parameter Store and used direct environment variables:**

1. **Removed environment variable:** `USE_PARAMETER_STORE` (deleted from Lightsail deployment config)
2. **Kept direct environment variables:**
   - `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:Welcome2ppms!@karematch-db...`
   - `SESSION_SECRET=ire9naslXt6kh8DPqPm+KACgT6YMqv95VQl4r2v...`
   - `ENCRYPTION_KEY=pDKEOfmV0N8nm4AsxAq4FsF+erq1ijJ1Qx5NMw+0NfM=`

3. **Redeployed** - application started successfully

**Application logic:**
```javascript
// server/index.ts (loadSecrets function)
if (process.env.USE_PARAMETER_STORE === 'true') {
  // Fetch from AWS Parameter Store
  // ‚ùå This path was failing
} else {
  // Use environment variables directly
  // ‚úÖ This path works
}
```

#### Lessons Learned

1. **Don't set USE_PARAMETER_STORE=true unless actually using Parameter Store**
2. **Environment variables in Lightsail work fine** for secrets - Parameter Store is optional
3. **Parameter Store requires:**
   - IAM role attached to Lightsail service
   - `ssm:GetParameter` permission in the role
   - Actual parameters created in Systems Manager
4. **Application startup logs were excellent** - made debugging much easier

#### When to Use Parameter Store vs Environment Variables

**Use Environment Variables (Simpler):**
- ‚úÖ Secrets visible only in AWS console (not in code)
- ‚úÖ No additional IAM setup required
- ‚úÖ No additional AWS service dependencies
- ‚úÖ Faster startup (no API calls)
- ‚úÖ Works for most applications
- ‚úÖ **Recommended for Lightsail deployments**

**Use Parameter Store (More Complex):**
- ‚úÖ Centralized secret management across multiple services
- ‚úÖ Automatic secret rotation
- ‚úÖ Audit trail for secret access
- ‚úÖ Secret versioning
- ‚ùå Requires IAM role setup
- ‚ùå Requires creating parameters in SSM
- ‚ùå Slower startup (API calls to fetch secrets)
- ‚ùå More complex debugging
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Only use if you have a specific need**

#### Prevention for Next Time

**Option A: Use Environment Variables Only (Recommended for Lightsail)**

1. **Don't set `USE_PARAMETER_STORE` at all**
2. Set secrets directly as environment variables in Lightsail
3. Simple, fast, secure

**Option B: Properly Configure Parameter Store (If Required)**

1. **Create parameters in AWS Systems Manager:**
   ```bash
   aws ssm put-parameter --name /karematch/database-url --value "postgresql://..." --type SecureString
   aws ssm put-parameter --name /karematch/session-secret --value "..." --type SecureString
   aws ssm put-parameter --name /karematch/encryption-key --value "..." --type SecureString
   ```

2. **Create IAM role for Lightsail container service:**
   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "ssm:GetParameter",
                   "ssm:GetParameters"
               ],
               "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:*:parameter/karematch/*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

3. **Attach role to Lightsail service** (via AWS Console or CLI)

4. **Set `USE_PARAMETER_STORE=true`** in environment variables

5. **Remove actual secret values** from environment variables (no longer needed)

---

### Issue #4: ECR vs Lightsail Registry Confusion

**Timeline:** Throughout deployment
**Severity:** üü° Medium - Caused initial deployment failures

#### Problem Description

Deployment scripts attempted to use Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) but:
1. IAM user lacked ECR permissions
2. ECR repository didn't exist
3. Lightsail has its own container registry that doesn't require ECR

**Failed deployment configuration:**
```json
{
  "containers": {
    "karematch": {
      "image": "051826703172.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/karematch:latest"
    }
  }
}
```

**Error:**
```
The image does not exist in your stored images
```

#### Root Cause

**Confusion between three different container registries:**

1. **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**
   - Separate AWS service for container images
   - Requires: IAM permissions, repository creation, authentication
   - Image URL format: `{account-id}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com/{repo}:{tag}`
   - Cost: $0.10 per GB per month storage

2. **Lightsail's Built-in Registry**
   - Integrated with Lightsail container service
   - Requires: lightsailctl plugin to push images
   - Image URL format: `:service-name.label.version` (e.g., `:karematch.latest.1`)
   - Cost: Included with Lightsail container service
   - **Problem:** lightsailctl plugin didn't work on Windows

3. **Docker Hub (Public Registry)**
   - Third-party public container registry
   - Requires: Docker Hub account
   - Image URL format: `username/repo:tag` (e.g., `mylaiviet/karematch:latest`)
   - Cost: Free for public images
   - **Solution we used**

#### Solution

**Used Docker Hub** as the primary registry:
- Simplest setup
- No AWS-specific tools required
- Works reliably cross-platform
- Good for development and non-sensitive images

#### Lessons Learned

1. **Understand registry options before deployment:**
   - ECR: Best for production AWS deployments with private images
   - Lightsail registry: Good if lightsailctl works
   - Docker Hub: Best for development and quick deployments

2. **Match deployment scripts to chosen registry:**
   - `deploy-from-amd64.ps1` was configured for ECR
   - Should have been configured for Docker Hub or Lightsail registry

3. **Test registry authentication before deployment:**
   - ECR requires `aws ecr get-login-password`
   - Lightsail requires `lightsailctl`
   - Docker Hub requires `docker login`

#### Prevention for Next Time

**Choose registry strategy upfront:**

**For Development/Testing:**
```powershell
# Use Docker Hub
docker tag app:latest username/app:latest
docker push username/app:latest
# In Lightsail: image = "username/app:latest"
```

**For Production (Private Images):**
```bash
# Use ECR
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name app
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin {account}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com
docker tag app:latest {account}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com/app:latest
docker push {account}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com/app:latest
# In Lightsail: image = "{account}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com/app:latest"
```

**Document registry choice in deployment guide.**

## Recommendations for Future Deployments

### ‚úÖ DO

1. **Use Docker Hub for Development/Staging**
   - Simple, reliable, cross-platform
   - No AWS-specific dependencies
   - Free for public images
   - Script: [push-via-docker-hub.ps1](../../push-via-docker-hub.ps1)

2. **Use Environment Variables for Secrets in Lightsail**
   - Simple configuration
   - No IAM role setup required
   - Fast application startup
   - Adequate security for most use cases

3. **Test Deployment Scripts on Target Platform**
   - If deploying from Windows, test all scripts on Windows first
   - Don't assume Linux-based documentation applies to Windows

4. **Create Comprehensive Health Checks**
   - Our `/health` endpoint was invaluable for debugging
   - Include environment info, memory stats, uptime

5. **Use Detailed Application Startup Logging**
   - Log all configuration settings (without secrets)
   - Log each step of initialization
   - Made troubleshooting much faster

6. **Grant Broad IAM Permissions During Development**
   - Use `lightsail:*` during development
   - Restrict permissions after deployment is working
   - Saves hours of permission debugging

### ‚ùå DON'T

1. **Don't Rely on lightsailctl Plugin on Windows**
   - Plugin discovery is unreliable
   - Use Docker Hub or ECR instead
   - If you must use it, test thoroughly first or use AWS CloudShell

2. **Don't Enable USE_PARAMETER_STORE Without Full Setup**
   - Requires IAM role on container service
   - Requires parameters in Systems Manager
   - Requires `ssm:GetParameter` permissions
   - Only use if you have a specific need

3. **Don't Mix Registry Strategies**
   - Pick one: ECR, Lightsail registry, or Docker Hub
   - Configure all scripts for that registry
   - Don't switch mid-deployment

4. **Don't Deploy Without Testing Locally First**
   - Our local Docker test worked perfectly
   - Gave confidence the issue was infrastructure, not code
   - Command: `docker run -p 5001:5000 karematch:latest`

5. **Don't Skip Documentation**
   - Document issues as they happen
   - Future deployments will be much faster
   - This document you're reading is proof of value

## Architecture Decisions and Tradeoffs

### Decision: Docker Hub vs ECR vs Lightsail Registry

**Chose: Docker Hub**

**Rationale:**
- ‚úÖ Simplest setup - works immediately
- ‚úÖ No AWS-specific dependencies (lightsailctl, ECR permissions)
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- ‚úÖ Free for public images
- ‚úÖ Good for non-production environments

**Tradeoffs:**
- ‚ùå Images are public (anyone can pull them)
- ‚ùå Limited to 200 pulls per 6 hours (free tier)
- ‚ùå Not ideal for production secrets or proprietary code

**When to Switch to ECR:**
- Production deployment with sensitive code
- Need private images
- Need integration with AWS security scanning
- Need fine-grained IAM access control

### Decision: Environment Variables vs Parameter Store

**Chose: Environment Variables**

**Rationale:**
- ‚úÖ Simpler setup - no IAM roles needed
- ‚úÖ Faster application startup (no API calls)
- ‚úÖ Adequate security (secrets not in code, only in AWS console)
- ‚úÖ Easier debugging

**Tradeoffs:**
- ‚ùå No centralized secret management
- ‚ùå No automatic secret rotation
- ‚ùå No audit trail for secret access
- ‚ùå Secrets duplicated across services

**When to Switch to Parameter Store:**
- Multiple services sharing secrets
- Need secret rotation
- Compliance requirements for secret auditing
- Centralized secret management across AWS accounts

### Decision: Lightsail vs ECS/Fargate

**Chose: Lightsail**

**Rationale:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed monthly cost ($7/month for Nano)
- ‚úÖ Simpler setup than ECS
- ‚úÖ Includes load balancer and SSL
- ‚úÖ Good for small to medium traffic

**Tradeoffs:**
- ‚ùå Less scalable than ECS
- ‚ùå Fewer configuration options
- ‚ùå Limited to specific instance sizes
- ‚ùå Less integration with other AWS services

**When to Switch to ECS:**
- Need auto-scaling based on traffic
- Need spot instances for cost optimization
- Need integration with AWS App Mesh, CloudMap, etc.
- Traffic exceeds Lightsail's capacity
