3. **Due Diligence** - Verify all credentials through primary sources when possible
4. **Transparency** - Clear communication with providers about requirements and status
5. **Ongoing Monitoring** - Regular re-verification of licenses and credentials

### Scope
This verification process applies to all mental health providers on the platform, including:
- Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSW)
- Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists (LMFT)
