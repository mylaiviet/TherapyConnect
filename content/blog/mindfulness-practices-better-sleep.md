# Can't Sleep? Try These 3 Mindfulness Techniques Tonight

If you lie awake at night with racing thoughts or check the clock wondering why sleep won't come, you're not alone. This article gives you two mindfulness-based techniques from CBT for insomnia that you can try tonight to fall asleep faster.

## Why Sleep Problems Matter

Poor sleep doesn't just make you tired. It affects mood, concentration, immune function, and long-term health. When you can't sleep, the next day suffers. When sleep problems continue for weeks, everything else in life gets harder—work performance drops, relationships strain, and mental health often worsens.

Many people with sleep problems develop anxiety about sleep itself. You start worrying about whether you'll sleep before you even get in bed. This worry makes falling asleep even harder, creating a cycle that's difficult to break without specific techniques.

## Common Sleep Mistakes

You might be doing things that seem like they should help but actually make sleep worse:
- Going to bed super early to "catch up" on sleep (confuses your body's clock)
- Lying in bed awake for hours trying to force sleep (teaches your brain that bed equals being awake)
- Checking your phone when you can't sleep (blue light signals your brain it's daytime)
- Replaying the day or planning tomorrow while lying there (activates your mind when it needs to quiet)

The techniques below work better than these common approaches because they're based on how sleep actually works.

## How CBT Addresses Sleep

CBT for insomnia (CBT-I) is the gold standard treatment for sleep problems. It works from a simple principle: your thoughts and behaviors around sleep directly affect whether you can sleep. Racing thoughts keep your brain activated. Lying in bed awake trains your brain to associate bed with wakefulness.

The tools below come from CBT-I and help you calm your mind and retrain your brain's sleep associations.

## Tool 1: Body Scan for Sleep

Racing thoughts keep your mind active when it needs to rest. A body scan redirects attention away from thoughts and toward physical sensations, which naturally calms your nervous system.

**Steps (10-15 minutes):**
1. **Lie in bed in a comfortable position**
2. **Close your eyes and notice your breathing** (don't change it, just notice)
3. **Bring attention to your toes** (notice any sensation—warmth, coolness, tingling, or nothing at all)
4. **Slowly move attention up your body:** feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, chest, fingers, hands, arms, shoulders, neck, face, head
5. **Spend about 10-20 seconds on each body part**
6. **When thoughts come (they will), gently notice them and return attention to your body**
7. **If you finish the scan and you're still awake, start again**

**Why it works:** Your brain can't simultaneously focus on body sensations and race through anxious thoughts. Redirecting attention breaks the thought loop that keeps you awake.

**Example:** Sarah used to lie awake listing everything she needed to do tomorrow. She'd check the clock every 20 minutes, getting more frustrated. After trying body scans for one week, she fell asleep within the scan most nights. When thoughts interrupted, she noticed them without judgment and returned to scanning.

**Tracking:** Don't track during the technique (looking at phone or clock defeats the purpose). In the morning, note whether you tried it and roughly how long before you fell asleep. Over a week, you'll see patterns.

**Adaptations:**
- If lying still feels impossible, do gentle stretching first, then lie down for the scan
- Use a guided body scan audio if you prefer voice guidance
- If certain body parts hold tension, pause there longer and imagine breathing into that area

**Try tonight:** As soon as you get in bed, start at your toes and work up slowly. When your mind wanders (it will), that's normal—gently return attention to your body.

## Tool 2: Cognitive Defusion for Sleep Worries

When you can't sleep, unhelpful thoughts pile up: "I'll never fall asleep," "Tomorrow will be terrible," "There's something wrong with me." These thoughts create anxiety, and anxiety prevents sleep. Cognitive defusion doesn't try to stop thoughts—it changes your relationship with them so they have less power.

**Steps (5 minutes):**
1. **Notice a thought that's keeping you awake** (example: "I'll never fall asleep")
2. **Instead of treating it as truth, label it:** "I'm having the thought that I'll never fall asleep"
3. **Add even more distance:** "I notice I'm having the thought that I'll never fall asleep"
4. **Imagine the thought floating by like a cloud or leaf on a stream**—you see it, but you don't grab onto it
5. **Return attention to your breath or body**

**Why it works:** When you believe the thought "I'll never fall asleep," your body responds with stress. When you recognize it as just a thought (not a fact), your body can relax.

**Example:**

*Without defusion:*
- Thought: "I need to fall asleep right now or tomorrow will be awful"
- Response: Stress increases, body tenses, definitely can't sleep

*With defusion:*
- Thought: "I need to fall asleep right now or tomorrow will be awful"
- Defusion: "I'm noticing the thought that I need to fall asleep right now. That's just my anxious brain talking."
- Response: Thought still exists, but has less emotional charge. Body can relax slightly.

**Tracking:** In the morning, write down one thought you defused during the night. Notice whether defusing the thought seemed to help you feel less anxious (even if you didn't fall asleep immediately).

**Adaptations:**
- If labeling thoughts feels awkward, just imagine them floating away
- Some people prefer imagining thoughts as cars driving past
- You can also say "Thank you, brain, for that thought" and refocus on breathing

**Try tonight:** When you notice a sleep-related worry, say to yourself "I'm having the thought that [worry]" and imagine it floating away like a cloud.

## When to Get Out of Bed

If you've been lying awake for 20 minutes and feel frustrated, get up. Go to another room, do something calm and boring (read a dull book, listen to quiet music), and return to bed only when you feel sleepy.

This might seem counterintuitive, but it prevents your brain from learning that bed equals lying awake. You're teaching your brain: bed is only for sleep.

## Your Options for More Sleep Support

**Self-help works if:**
- You've had sleep problems for less than 3 months
- Problems happen 2-3 nights per week
- You can practice these techniques consistently

**Consider professional help if:**
- Sleep problems exist longer than 3 months
- You can't function the next day
- You suspect sleep apnea (loud snoring, gasping, stopping breathing)
- Insomnia happens most nights

**Treatment options:**
- **CBT-I (CBT for Insomnia):** 6-8 sessions, highly effective, often works better than medication long-term
- **Sleep study:** If you suspect sleep apnea or other physical sleep disorders
- **Medication:** Short-term option, but doesn't teach skills for long-term sleep

CBT-I is considered first-line treatment for chronic insomnia because it addresses the root causes, not just symptoms.

## Finding Help

**If you decide to see a sleep specialist:**
- Search "CBT-I therapist" or "behavioral sleep medicine"
- Look for psychologists or therapists with specific insomnia training
- Many offer telehealth (works well for sleep treatment)

**Questions to ask:**
- "Do you specialize in CBT for insomnia?"
- "How many sessions does treatment typically take?"
- "Will you teach me techniques to use long-term?"

## Safety Information

**Seek medical evaluation if you:**
- Stop breathing during sleep (or partner reports this)
- Experience extreme daytime sleepiness
- Have sleep problems plus depression or anxiety
- Use substances to fall asleep regularly

**Get urgent help if:**
- Sleep deprivation leads to thoughts of self-harm
- You're so exhausted you can't safely drive or work

Call 988 (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline) for mental health crises.

## Measuring Progress

**Track these weekly:**
- How many nights did I practice a technique?
- Average time to fall asleep (rough estimate)
- How rested do I feel the next day (0-10)?
- Number of nights with good sleep vs poor sleep

Don't track these measurements during the night (looking at your phone defeats the purpose). Estimate in the morning.

**What improvement looks like:**
- Falling asleep 15-30 minutes faster than before
- Fewer nights lying awake for hours
- Feeling more rested despite similar sleep time (quality improves before quantity)
- Less anxiety about sleep

Progress usually takes 1-2 weeks of consistent practice.

## Sleep Hygiene Basics

These techniques work better alongside basic sleep hygiene:
- Keep bedroom cool (65-68°F)
- Use bed only for sleep (not work, TV, phone scrolling)
- Avoid screens 30-60 minutes before bed
- Keep sleep and wake times consistent (even weekends)
- Avoid caffeine after 2 PM
- Get daylight exposure early in day

You probably know these already. The mindfulness techniques help when sleep hygiene alone isn't enough.

## Adaptations

**If you work nights:** Same principles apply. Consistent schedule matters more than specific hours.

**If you have chronic pain:** Combine body scan with acceptance of discomfort rather than fighting it. Focus on parts of body that don't hurt.

**If you're neurodivergent:** External structure helps. Set alarm for bedtime routine. Use apps or audio guides for body scans.

**If anxiety is severe:** These techniques help, but might not be enough alone. Consider therapy for underlying anxiety.

## The Bottom Line

You can't force sleep, but you can create conditions that make sleep more likely. Body scans and cognitive defusion calm your nervous system and reduce sleep anxiety. Practice them consistently for two weeks before deciding whether they help.

**Do tonight:** Try one technique as soon as you get in bed. If it doesn't work the first night, that's normal. Try again tomorrow night. Most people need 3-7 nights of practice before seeing improvement.
