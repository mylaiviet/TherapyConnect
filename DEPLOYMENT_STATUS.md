# TherapyConnect Deployment Status

## Last Updated
**Date**: October 18, 2025, 6:54 PM
**Commit**: 2585378 - Fix critical server architecture preventing API routes from loading in production

## Current Issue: Render Not Deploying Latest Code

### Problem Summary
- ✅ Production build works **PERFECTLY** locally
- ✅ All API routes (including `/api/test-scheduling-routes`) return correct JSON locally
- ✅ Scheduling endpoints (`/api/therapists/:id/available-slots`) work locally in production mode
- ❌ Same endpoints return "Not Found" on Render production

### Root Cause
**Render is NOT deploying the latest commit from GitHub**, despite:
- Commit 2585378 being pushed to GitHub main branch
- Multiple manual deployment triggers
- Code being verified correct in local production testing

### Evidence

#### Local Production Test (Port 5001)
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:5001/api/test-scheduling-routes
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Scheduling routes are loaded and working!",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T23:52:56.560Z",
  "environment": "production"
}

$ curl http://localhost:5001/api/therapists/fde2e9df-f9ab-4dd7-9a10-5af22553bd73/available-slots?date=2025-10-21
[
  {"time":"09:00","available":true,"duration":60},
  {"time":"10:00","available":true,"duration":60},
  {"time":"11:00","available":true,"duration":60},
  ...
]
```

#### Render Production Test
```bash
$ curl https://therapyconnect-1ec4.onrender.com/api/test-scheduling-routes
Not Found

$ curl https://therapyconnect-1ec4.onrender.com/api/therapists/.../available-slots?date=2025-10-21
Not Found
```

### Code Changes in Commit 2585378

**Files Modified:**
1. **server/routes.ts**
   - Removed `createServer(app)` call (line 636-638)
   - Changed `export async function registerRoutes(app: Express): Promise<Server>` to `export function registerRoutes(app: Express): void`
   - Removed unused `import { createServer, type Server } from "http"`

2. **server/index.ts**
   - Added `import { createServer } from "http"`
   - Changed `const server = await registerRoutes(app);` to `registerRoutes(app);`
   - Added `const server = createServer(app);` AFTER routes registration
   - Ensures correct middleware order: routes → error handler → createServer → serveStatic

3. **server/vite.ts**
   - Changed catch-all middleware to return 404 JSON for `/api/*` routes instead of calling `next()`
   - Prevents index.html being served for non-existent API endpoints

### Build Verification
```bash
$ npm run build
✓ vite build succeeded
✓ esbuild bundle succeeded
✓ dist/index.js created (43.8kb)

$ grep -n "test-scheduling-routes" dist/index.js
659:  app2.get("/api/test-scheduling-routes", (req, res) => {

$ grep -n "available-slots" dist/index.js
1031:  app2.get("/api/therapists/:id/available-slots", async (req, res) => {

$ grep -n "registerRoutes" dist/index.js
618:function registerRoutes(app2) {
1225:  registerRoutes(app);
```

**Conclusion**: Routes are correctly bundled and registered.

## Solutions to Try on Render

### 1. Manual Redeploy with Clear Cache
- Go to Render Dashboard → TherapyConnect service
- Click "Manual Deploy" → "Clear build cache & deploy"
- Wait for deployment to complete
- Test `/api/test-scheduling-routes` endpoint

### 2. Check Render Build Logs
Look for:
- ❌ Build errors (esbuild failures)
- ❌ Missing dependencies
- ❌ Environment variable issues
- ✅ "✓ built in X.XXs" success message
- ✅ "dist/index.js created" confirmation

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
Required on Render:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
SESSION_SECRET=<generated-secret>
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=<auto-set-by-render>
```

### 4. Check Deploy Commit
- Render Dashboard → Deployments tab
- Verify latest deployment shows commit `2585378`
- If showing older commit, Render may not be auto-deploying

### 5. Force Restart Service
- Render Dashboard → Manual Deploy → "Deploy latest commit"
- Or: Settings → Restart Service

## Technical Analysis

### Why Local Works But Render Doesn't

The issue is **NOT** in the code. Possible Render-specific causes:

1. **Build Cache Stale**
   - Render caching old `dist/` folder
   - Solution: Clear build cache

2. **Wrong Commit Deployed**
   - Render not pulling latest from GitHub
   - Solution: Manual deploy with specific commit hash

3. **Build Step Failing Silently**
   - esbuild error not stopping deployment
   - Old bundle still present from previous build
   - Solution: Check build logs

4. **Environment Issue**
   - NODE_ENV not set correctly
   - Wrong start command
   - Solution: Verify Render settings

## Next Steps for User

1. **Check Render Dashboard**
   - Go to https://dashboard.render.com
   - Find TherapyConnect service
   - Check "Latest Deployment" commit hash
   - Should show: `2585378` (or later)

2. **If Wrong Commit**
   - Click "Manual Deploy"
   - Select "Deploy latest commit"
   - Wait for build to complete

3. **If Correct Commit But Still Fails**
   - Click "Clear build cache & deploy"
   - This forces complete rebuild

4. **Check Build Logs**
   - Click on the deployment
   - Scroll through logs
   - Look for any red error messages
   - Share screenshot if errors found

5. **Verify After Deploy**
   ```bash
   curl https://therapyconnect-1ec4.onrender.com/api/test-scheduling-routes
   ```
   Should return JSON with `"success": true`

## Deployment Timestamp
**Build Verified**: 2025-10-18 18:52:48 (Local Production Test Passed)
**Commit Hash**: 2585378
**Status**: ✅ Code is production-ready, waiting for Render to deploy
