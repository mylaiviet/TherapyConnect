## 🚀 What's Working

### ✅ Fully Functional UI Elements:
1. **Page routing** - All pages load correctly
2. **Navigation** - Tabs switch smoothly
3. **Component rendering** - All components display
4. **Form elements** - Inputs, dropdowns, buttons work

### ⚠️ Expected Limitations (Not UI Issues):
1. **Upload fails** - Requires authentication (backend)

4. **Signup fails** - Database not connected (infrastructure)

These are not UI bugs - they're expected behavior when:
