## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### 2025-10-19
- **Decision:** Created aws-migration branch for parallel development
- **Note:** Render deployment (main branch) continues serving production
- **Note:** Will not merge to main until AWS deployment proven stable
- **Note:** Database strategy TBD: Keep Neon or migrate to RDS
- **Action Item:** Need to decide on ACM certificate approach (manual or automated)
- **Fix:** Dockerfile path issue - Vite outputs to `dist/public/` not `client/dist/`, simplified Dockerfile to copy entire dist/ directory
- **Test Result:** Docker build successful, docker-compose tested, application running correctly on port 5000
- **Implementation:** Phase 2 complete - Added AWS Secrets Manager, /health endpoint, RDS SSL config, session store SSL
- **Test Result:** /health endpoint working, secrets load correctly, database connections functional
- **Note:** All code changes backward compatible - works in local dev and ready for AWS deployment
